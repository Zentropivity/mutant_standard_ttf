# Build Mutant Standard as TTF font

Why? Because its a great emoji font! I want to see them all over my desktop.

## How?

First you need to make sure the required tools are installed:

- `nushell` (probably could have made it without, but I like to script using it `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`)
- `python` (and its virtualenv/venv and pip)
- `git` of course

0. Make sure you have the submodules. Either clone this repo with `--recursive` or do `git submodule update --init`
1. Create a python virtual environment and activate it, like: `python -m venv venv` then source the activation file for your shell (for nushell just run `./pyvenv`)
2. Run `./build_ttf.nu`  
   this produces the font file in `out/build/MutantStandard-Regular.ttf`
3. On linux, you could also copy the font and its license to the system fonts by running `sudo ./install.nu`

## Fuzzy finder!

If you want to be able to fuzzy find specific emoji from the Mutant Standard set, you could try running `export_memoji_codes.nu`  
The output text file will have the format of `emoji character` `space` `emoji shortcode` (so a line may be like this: `ðŸ˜¸ cat_smile`)

There is an example fuzzy finder *nushell* script (module) using `sk` and `wl-copy` at `./tools/_memoji.nu`  
Use it like `use ./tools/_memoji.nu *` then `memoji copy` to pick and copy to clipboard.

Or if you know you want to touch 3 files named as different emoji, run this after the use: `for $ in 1..3 { memoji | touch $in }`
